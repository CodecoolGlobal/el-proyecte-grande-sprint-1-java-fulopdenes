# TaskTiger üêØ
### A school project by our hard-working team, _SOLID_.

The server works through a free service provider, so it does not run permanently. After the first request, it starts and you need to wait approximately 150 ms, then refresh the current page. You can reach the public website [here](https://tasktiger.onrender.com).

## About the Project

This was our last team project in [Codecool](https://codecool.com/)'s 10-month Full-Stack developer course. It was a 4-sprint long project.<br>
**TaskTiger** is a platform where clients can connect with 'Taskers' to complete different jobs/tasks for them, creating easier access to different service providers. All this within a few comfortable clicks/taps.<br>
The project includes authentication and authorization, profile pages, booking reservations, messaging, reviewing, along with many other features.

**This repository is only the backend of the project!** You can find the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/miz092/TaskTigerFrontend).

_This README is only about the backend part of the project. For the frontend documentation, refer to the frontend repository's README._

### Used Technologies

* Java 17
* Spring Boot
* Spring Security with JSON Web Tokens
* Spring Data JPA
* PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

You'll need the Maven build tool and Java 17 to build the application. For the database a new PostgreSQL database will be needed called `tasktiger`. Username and password for the database need to be passed to the application as _environment variables_.

Now the application can be started. The database will be filled with some initial data. Spring Boot will launch the server, and the endpoints will be live.
